class PolicyPermission(BasePermission):
    """
    A permission class that checks if the user has the required permissions
    to perform the action on the view or object.

    Either policies or object_policies should be set in order to check the permissions.
    If any policy list is None, the permission will be granted for that policy level.
    If a policy list is set to a list, all actions in the view will be marked as access
    denied by default, so policy rules must be set explicitly for each action.

    - policies: A list of policies that will be used to check the permissions
                for the view.
    - object_policies: A list of policies that will be used to check the permissions
                for the object.

    A policy is a dictionary with the following attributes:
    - action: A string or a list of strings that represents the action(s) that
                the user is trying to perform. 
                The action can be a view action name or a request method name
                when the action is not defined in the view.
                Passing a wild card ("*" or ["*"]) will match any action.
    - permission: A string or a list of strings that represents the permission(s)
                that the user must have to perform the action(s).
                Passing a wild card ("*" or ["*"]) will mark that policy
                permissions as granted.
    - conditions: An optional list of callables that will be checked to grant
                the permission. A condition accepts the following parameters:
                - user: The user that is trying to perform the action.
                - action: The view action or request method.
                - obj: The object that the user is trying to access (for object 
                       level permissions).
                - request: The request object.
                - view: The view object.

    The permission class will check that the user has all the permissions matched
    and that all the conditions matched return True in order to grant access.
